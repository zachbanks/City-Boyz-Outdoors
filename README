== City Boyz Outdoors Website
This site is a mostly static website (with the exception of a few dynamic features) for an Ohio based hunting group. This code is not meant to be open source in the traditional sense that others should fork it; however, Rails developers are more than welcome to use this code as an example on how to build a relatively simple website in Rails 3.
